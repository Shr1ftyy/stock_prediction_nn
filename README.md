# A simple recurrent neural network used for stock prediction

- Currently used regression to predict next stock close price _(literally just relies on a window of
last close prices of a stock)_


Future patches:

 - NLP & News Sentiment Analysis - bag of words etc.
 - Cleaner Code
 - Use Pytorch instead of Keras/Tensorflow as a backend???
